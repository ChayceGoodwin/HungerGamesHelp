<p>Here in about us, we will talk about a few things about not only the website but also the creators of the website which include, me(Chayce), Tristan and Hayden:</p>
<p> Our website is a non profitable website that will provide information about 'The Hunger Games' and the website also has a copy of the book in case you can't find the book to read. We would also like to give credit to Suzanne Collins for writing the book and any compliments about the novel should go to her and not any of us.</p>
<p> Lets Introduce you to the members in this project, Heres Tristan introducing himself.I am a 9th grade sudent who made the minecraft world with Hayden and put in lots of effort to make it as good as possible. im the world I featured the cornacopia and placed down heaps of trees to make the arena look the same as it is. We did have to replicate the arena from the movie as we couldn't get a visual of the arena just from reading the novel but it should still help show what the arena might/could look like in the novel. The next project contributor is Hayden lets see his introduction. I am 14 student who took part in this website and helped contribute to the minecraft world. I enjoy playing music which is why I'm part of the imex program but at the beginning of this year I got the chance to enroll into the ignite prgram which I happily accepted because I thought it was a dance program.</p>
<p> Lastly, I'm Chayce the main developer of the website. I'm a 14 year old in class of 9G, I sometimes work on websites for fun but it was also part of my Digital Technologies Assignment which I helped most of the people in my class to make them pass the class. I coded the book into the website where you can freely access it in the<a href="Book.html" class="Yes">Novel Page</a>. I hope you enjoy the website and thank you for taking your time to read this.</p>

<h1 class="entire"> Novel Summary </h1>
<p> On Reaping Day in District 12, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her sister Prim’s place as a tribute in the Hunger Games. Peeta Mellark is chosen as the male tribute. In the Capitol, Katniss and Peeta impress with their fiery outfits and Peeta’s confession of love during interviews. The Games begin, and Katniss initially avoids confrontation. She allies with Rue from District 11 but is devastated when Rue is killed. Katniss and Peeta use their romance to gain sponsor support. When Peeta is injured, Katniss braves the Cornucopia to retrieve medicine. After a grueling battle with Cato and mutant wolf creatures, Katniss and Peeta threaten to eat poisonous berries to force the Capitol to declare them both winners. The Capitol relents, and they return home as victors. Katniss learns from Haymitch that their defiance has angered the Capitol, putting her family at risk. Peeta is hurt to discover the romance was partly a strategy, but they hold hands one last time for the cameras as they arrive back in District 12. </p>
